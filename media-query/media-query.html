        <h2>2 Nephi 2:2</h2>
        <p>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given 
            them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty 
            and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose 
            captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; 
            for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</p>

            every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will 
            take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</p>
