            The hobbies I always cycle through are: writing, art, and music. My loving husband, two beautiful boys and I are now living in Frisco, Texas. 

            I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and I am passionate about the home being a center of learning and safety.

            I love talking about empowering mothers because of their profound affect on the next generation. Home is where change begins. 
            Let’s have discussions on how we can make the home a better place for you and your family!
